# Stereo Matching with Loopy Belief Propagation 

This repo includes Matlab code for stereo matching, 
i.e. estimating depth information from two different views of a scene, 
using loopy belief propagation.
The code is adapted from [github.com/alexprz/StereoMatching](https://github.com/alexprz/StereoMatching).
A nice tutorial on the same problem is [this page](http://nghiaho.com/?page_id=1366).
